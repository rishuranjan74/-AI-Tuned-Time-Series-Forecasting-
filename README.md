## AI-Tuned Time Series Forecasting 

COVID-19 time series forecasting using LSTM, ARIMA/SARIMA, and Polynomial Regression. Features EDA automation and hypertuning for optimized performance.

## Project Concept

This project's core objective is to forecast future COVID-19 case numbers by performing an in-depth time series analysis on historical data. It utilizes an **iterative statistical approach**, where every step from data understanding to model creation is systematically refined and improved.

The project begins with **automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to rapidly identify underlying patterns, trends, and seasonality within the data. Following this, advanced models such as **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), ARIMA/SARIMA, and Polynomial Regression** are implemented. Each model is then meticulously optimized through **hyperparameter tuning** to ensure the highest possible prediction accuracy.

Throughout this process, the focus is not only on precision but also on minimizing the computational time required for model training. As a result, this project stands as an excellent example of an efficient and highly accurate forecasting system.
